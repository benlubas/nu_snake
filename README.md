# nu_snake

hahahaha, if anyone is reading this, the first thing I want you to understand is that this in not an actual game of snake. I know what that is, I've made the game
in the past, this is not that. It's called snake b/c that's what Jack called it in lab. He made the original verison of this...thing... and I had free time and made it better 

His verion lives at [this link](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2500a/snake.html)
